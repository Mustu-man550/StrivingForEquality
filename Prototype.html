<h5 class="h">Our goal is to analyse and evaluate the differences between genders in terms of opportunity, pay, and education. We want to achieve a place that can portray values of equality, equity and neutralism. We believe that everyone should be treated equally in every aspect of daily life, there should also be equality in terms of the ability and opportunity to pick yourself up from adversity.</h5>
